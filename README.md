# Whatsgoodly Scraper!
This is a scraper that I'm building out for [Whatsgoodly](https://whatsgoodly.com/). I started this while I was watching some old Star Wars movies, so if you see anything ridiculous in here then please leave an issue!

##Usage
To use this scraper, first install the Python Geocoder library by running `pip install geocoder` from your terminal. Afterwards, just run `python main.py` to begin!


More features and instructions to come. For educational purposes only :)
